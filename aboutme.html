<p>A very entertaining picture from trivikram and pavan kalyan..artists performance are out of 
    the ordinary and pavan kalyan as sanjay sahu was excellent..the music is top notch but could 
    have been better as videos.. a few unnecessary scenes..Comedy scenes are just awesome and 
    bramhanandham's performance as pranav was totally out of the ordinary.. back grounds score 
    just rock!! and the dialogues are as usual at their best like in all trivikram movies...
    technically the movie can be very highly ranked...all together the movie is full of fun and 
    entertainment..a total worth for u're money..i have watched the movie 9 times is the theatre 
    and am still not bored of it...</p>
